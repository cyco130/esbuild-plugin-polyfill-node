# esbuild-plugin-polyfill-node

[ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) plugin to polyfill Node.js built-ins and globals, geared towards edge environments and Deno (including Deno Deploy). It consists of two plugins: `polyfillNode`, which should work for most cases, and `polyfillNodeForDeno` which targets Deno and Deno Deploy specifically.

## Installation

```sh
npm install esbuild-plugin-polyfill-node
```

## `polyfillNode`

### Usage

```js
import { build } from "esbuild";
import { polyfillNode } from "esbuild-plugin-polyfill-node";

build({
	entryPoints: ["src/index.js"],
	bundle: true,
	outfile: "dist/bundle.js",
	plugins: [
		polyfillNode({
			// Options (optional)
		}),
	],
});
```

### Options

- `globals.buffer`: Whether to inject the `Buffer` global. Disable it to prevent code like `if (typeof Buffer !== "undefined")` from pulling in the (quite large) `buffer-es6` polyfill. Default: `true`.
- `globals.process`: Whether to inject the `process` global. Disable it to prevent `process.env.NODE_ENV` from pulling in the `process-es6` polyfill. You can use the `define` option to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` instead. Default: `true`.
- `polyfills`: Polyfills to inject. It's an object where the keys are the names of the polyfills and the values are `false`, `true`, or `"empty"`. `false` disables the polyfill, `true` enables it, and `"empty"` injects an empty polyfill.

- `zlib` as implemented in [`browserify-zlib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify-zlib)

¹ All except `crypto` and `fs` polyfills are on by default. `crypto` and `fs` have to be explicitly enabled. Otherwise, they will be replaced with empty stubs.

### Empty stubs

The followings modules are only provided as empty stubs. It is illegal to pass `true` for them.

- `dns`
- `dgram`
- `child_process`
- `cluster`
- `module`
- `net`
- `readline`
- `repl`
- `tls`

### Globals

- `global` (aliased to `globalThis`)
- `process`¹ (imports the `process` module)
- `Buffer`¹ (imports the `buffer` module)
- `__dirname` (always `"/"`)
- `__filename` (always `"/index.js"`)

¹ `process` and `Buffer` shims can be disabled by passing `globals.process: false` and `globals.buffer: false` to the plugin options.

## `polyfillNodeForDeno`

This plugin uses Deno's [`std/node`](https://deno.land/std/node) library to polyfill Node builtins and globals. Optionally, it can use polyfills from NPM instead.

### Usage

```js
import { build } from "esbuild";
import { polyfillNodeForDeno } from "esbuild-plugin-polyfill-node";

build({
	entryPoints: ["src/index.js"],
	bundle: true,
	outfile: "dist/bundle.js",
	plugins: [
		polyfillNodeForDeno({
			// Options (optional)
		}),
	],
});
```

### Options

- `stdVersion`: Version of the Deno standard library to use. Default: `"0.160.0"`.
- `globals`: Whether to inject global polyfills (`process`, `Buffer`, `setImmediate`, `clearImmediate`, `__dirname`, and `__filename`). Default: `true`.
- `polyfills`: Polyfills to inject. It's an object where the keys are the names of the polyfills and the values are `false`, `true`, `"npm"` or `"empty"`. `false` disables the polyfill, `true` enables it (default where exists), `"npm"` injects a polyfill from the NPM (default for `"domain"`, `"punycode"`, `"vm"`, and `"zlib"`), and `"empty"` injects an empty polyfill (default for [missing polyfills](#empty-stubs)).
